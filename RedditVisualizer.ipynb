    "# Reddit r/politics/hot top comment analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit is an extremely popular online forum, ranking as #23 in internet traffic engagement(according to https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com). It is broken into subreddits, shortcut as r/, where users can post relevant links, images, videos, or simply text posts relevant to the particular subreddit. These posts are sometimes called threads. Other users may then reply to these threads with comments. This allows other users to reply to their comments, allowing for robust(occasionally), informative(sometimes), interesting(inane?) and diverse(hah!) conversation. \n",
    "\n",
    "All users registered to Reddit may upvote or downvote any thread or comment on the site, creating a score for each item. This score is known as Karma. Reddit also tracks the total Karma for each user (the cumulative of their earned karma from their posts comments). \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to analyze the top comments in trending  threads from the r/politics subreddit, in the section known as hot/. Put all of this together, and you get the URL of the site we are scraping for data: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/hot."

    "The end goal of these analyses on comments to attempt to ferret out accounts that are considered \"troll\" or \"bot\" accounts. These are accounts that are either automated to post(\"bot\") or ones where people are intentionally posting frequently to get a reaction(\"troll\"). This project is currently in the exploratory phase, however, and will draw no clear conclusions. We will merely be looking at trends in the collected data to see if anything of interest pops up."

I will need to do further research to try to suss out which accounts are \"bots\", but it seems a lot of them would be considered \"troll\" accounts. I have been looking at their post histories, and in general these accounts seem to post short, pointed comments. \n",
    "It could be that this is the nature of communication on the internet: it takes a lot more work to post a long, thought out comment, and by nature people may simply do that less on average. It could also be that the accounts at the upper and lower ends of the spectrum have more nefarious means than communication. \n",
